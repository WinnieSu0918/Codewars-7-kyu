  Title:
    Love vs friendship
    
  Description:
    Ifã€€a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 ... z = 26

    Then l + o + v + e = 54

    and f + r + i + e + n + d + s + h + i + p = 108

    So friendship is twice as strong as love :-)

    Your task is to write a function which calculates the value of a word based off the sum of the alphabet positions of its characters.

    The input will always be made of only lowercase letters and will never be empty.
